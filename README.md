# DevilTwin-ESP8266 (evil-twin)
An evil twin attack is a spoofing cyberattack that works by tricking users into connecting to a fake Wi-Fi access point that mimics a legitimate network. Once a user is connected to an “evil twin” network, hackers can access everything from their network traffic to private login credentials.


# ESP8266-Devil-Twin v2
Welcome to the project. This project is inspired by https://github.com/vk496/linset and https://github.com/SpacehuhnTech/esp8266_deauther

Use this tool only on networks that you have permission for.

Note: Removed AsyncWebServer due to performance and stability Note: Reworked deauthing - now it changes channel so deauthing can work properly

Note: I don't know anything about licenes, copyrights, etc.

Credits to: Deauthing: https://github.com/SpacehuhnTech/esp8266_deauther // Learned from
ESP8266 Core: https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32 // Edited and used

# How to compile:
Check first: https://github.com/SpacehuhnTech/esp8266_deauther/tree/v1 It has steps on how to enable wifi_send_pkt_freedom (crucial for deauthing to work)

After that, simply open in Arduino IDE and compile/upload Feel free to change html pages (I am still using strings, version 3 might be even more stable with the use of char arrays) Also, feel free to add suggestions, I am sorry about not being active for a long time, and for unanswered issues but I hope this basic version works for everyone.

Note: Deauthing might not work on some phones due to the fact that I am using broadcast as station target (attacks everyone on network and not specific client).

# How to use:

1.Connect to the AP named "DevilTwin" with password "12345678" from your phone/PC.

2.Select the target you want (list of available APs refreshes every 30secs - page reload is required)

3.Click the Start Evil-Twin button and reconnect to the newly created AP named same as your target (will be open)

4.After connecting, make sure you chooes "Use this network as is" (may differ on different devices)

5.Go to your favorite browser and navigate to 192.168.4.1/admin

6.Once there DO NOT change your target, only start/stop deauthing and wait for someone to try and use the correct password.

7.Once correct password is found, AP will be restarted with default ssid "DevilTwin" with password "12345678" and at the bottom of a table you should be able to see something like  "Successfully got password for - SSID - Password
